# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Price Prediction using TensorFlow and LSTM

## Project Overview

Stock price prediction is a complex and challenging problem in finance, with important applications such as personal investment decision-making and algorithmic trading strategies. This project demonstrates how to build a predictive model for stock prices using **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for modeling time series data like stock prices.

Using historical stock data, we develop a deep learning model with TensorFlow to forecast future stock prices, specifically focusing on Apple stock as a case study.

## Dataset

The dataset contains daily stock price data over a five-year period for multiple companies, including Apple, Google, Nvidia, and others. Key features include:

- Date of the record
- Open and close prices
- Trading volume
- Company ticker symbol

The dataset was preprocessed to convert date fields to appropriate datetime formats and filtered to extract specific companies for exploratory analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Initial analysis focused on visualizing stock price trends and trading volumes over time for a selection of companies, highlighting:

- Variations between opening and closing prices across years
- Trading volume fluctuations
- Seasonal and market trends impacting stock behavior

A detailed examination of Appleâ€™s stock price from 2013 to 2018 was performed to understand historical price movements and prepare data for modeling.

## Data Preparation

The Apple stock data was split into training and testing subsets, with approximately 95% of the data used for training the model. The closing prices were scaled to a normalized range to improve the performance of the neural network.

Time series sequences of a fixed window size were created from the scaled training data to serve as input features, with the following dayâ€™s price as the target label. This format is ideal for sequential modeling using LSTM networks.

## Model Architecture

A deep learning model using stacked LSTM layers was designed to capture temporal dependencies in the stock price data. The model includes:

- Multiple LSTM layers to learn from sequential data and retain information over time
- Dense layers to process learned features
- Dropout layers to prevent overfitting
- A single output neuron for regression to predict the next dayâ€™s stock price

The model architecture was summarized and evaluated for suitability.

## Model Training and Evaluation

The model was compiled with the Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss function, optimized over multiple epochs. After training, the modelâ€™s predictions were generated on the test set.

Model performance was assessed using:

- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

These metrics quantified the average prediction error magnitude and provided insight into the accuracy of the model.

## Results and Visualization

Predicted stock prices were plotted alongside actual closing prices to visually assess model performance. The comparison revealed:

- Areas where the model closely tracked actual stock movements
- Periods with noticeable prediction deviations
- Overall trends successfully captured by the model

This visualization helps understand strengths and limitations in forecasting ability.

## Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates the application of LSTM networks for stock price prediction using historical time series data. The approach highlights:

- Effective preprocessing and feature engineering for time series data
- The capability of recurrent neural networks to model sequential dependencies in stock prices
- The importance of model evaluation with appropriate metrics and visualizations

With further refinement, such models can support investment strategies and financial forecasting tasks.
